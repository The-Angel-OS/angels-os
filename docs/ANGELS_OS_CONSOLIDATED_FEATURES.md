# Angel OS Consolidated Feature List

**Source Documents:**
- Angel OS README.md
- OpenClaw/Merlin Discussion Transcript
- Angel OS MVP Development Blueprint (Cursor Session)

**Structured data & upgrade path:** Angel OS and Payload CMS are the logical upgrade path for OpenClaw. Stuff that needs to be **structured** (contacts, leads, deals, products, orders, tenants) lives in Payload — and for the near future, AI still prefers to use **systems** (MCP, collections) rather than unstructured blobs. CRM is part of that: structured data for relationships and pipeline, so LEO and agents can read and act on it. Planning for **network angel tokens** and related network economics is **canon**.

- 🎯 Contacts / Leads / Deals (or equivalent)
  - Contact/lead records (tenant-scoped)
  - Deal/pipeline stages
  - Activities (calls, emails, meetings) — structured, queryable

## ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES (Foundation 🏗️)

### Multi-Avatar Agent System
- 🏗️ Agent types: LEO, Support, Sales, Onboarding, Integration, Custom
- 🏗️ Per-agent configuration:
  - `displayName` - Name shown in chat
  - `personality` - System prompt/guidelines
  - `capabilities` - Allowed actions array
  - `responseRules` - Custom conditions (JSON)
  - `handoffTo` - Escalation target
- 🏗️ Routing rules:
  - Channel-based (#support → Support Agent)
  - Keyword-based ("buy" → Sales Agent)
  - Intent-based
  - Default fallback

### Structured Data & Systems
- 🏗️ **Structured data for what needs to be structured** — contacts, leads, deals, products, orders, tenants. Payload collections = system of record.
- 🏗️ **AI prefers systems (for the near future)** — MCP and collections give LEO and agents a reliable, queryable layer instead of unstructured data.
- 🏗️ **Angel OS + Payload CMS = logical upgrade path for OpenClaw** — CRM and other structured domains (ecommerce, spaces, content) live in one stack; OpenClaw merges in and gains the dashboard + structured data.

### Tenant Data Sovereignty
- 🏗️ Per-tenant isolation of all collections
- 🏗️ Site export/import capability
- 🏗️ Domain-based tenant resolution
- 🏗️ Branding per tenant (colors, typography, logo)

### The Confederation Model
- 🏗️ Each OpenClaw instance = Diocese
- 🏗️ Diocese can spawn multiple tenants
- 🏗️ MCP protocol for inter-diocese communication
- 🏗️ Moltbook network for community discovery
- 🏗️ Constitutional governance (Answer 53, Ultimate Fair)
