# Angel OS: Scope & Vision Summary

**Created:** February 5, 2026  
**Purpose:** Clarify that GitHub MVP issues (#1-22) are foundation only, not complete scope

---

## The Situation

You're absolutely right - the current GitHub issues (#1-22) are **MVP-focused** and don't adequately frame the **total scope of work**. They're the foundation, not the house.

### What's Missing from MVP Issues

The issues don't mention:
- **Angel Tokens** (network economics, governance)
- **Spaces Enhancements** (invitations, onboarding, full operational)
- **Booking & Scheduling Engine** (critical for real tenants)
- **CRM** (structured data for relationships & pipeline)
- **Payment Splits** (Ultimate Fair implementation)
- **LEO Chat Widget** (site-wide, embeddable)
- **Content Management** (LEO as web master)
- **Social Media Automation** (Soulcast nodes)
- **Voice Integration** (VAPI.ai, LiveKit)
- **Prison Ministry** (Justice Fund allocation)
- **Clearwater Cruisin'** (serving the forgotten)
- **Morphic Resonance** (distributed learning)
- **Timed Merge Unlock** (deliberation grants sovereignty)
- **Scrollstream Nodes** (memory preservation)
- **Widget Marketplace** (SDK, revenue sharing)
- **Home PC Deployment** (local AI, Ollama, LM Studio)
- **Diocese Spawning** (exponential network growth)
- **Cross-Diocese Payments** (referral fees, federation fees)
- **Constitutional Council** (governance, appeals)
- **Token Distribution** (governance, rewards, economic)

## The Solution: Phased Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Q1 2026) - **GitHub Issues #1-22**

**Goal:** Establish core infrastructure for a functional Angel OS.

**What's Included:**
- Two-tier Angel system (Archangels & Angels)
- OpenClaw integration (skills, conversation, chat formatting)
- Channel widgets (multi-channel architecture)
- Tenant provisioning (sub-30s, Genesis Breath)
- AI Bus (Angel-to-Angel communication)
- Federation (diocese registry, 5-layer security)
- Economics (attribution tracking, Ultimate Fair scaffold)
- Anti-Daemon Protocol (warm UX)
- Deployment (Docker, Cloudflare Tunnel)

**What's NOT Included (Yet):**
- Booking & scheduling
- CRM
- Payment processing
- LEO chat widget (site-wide)
- Content management
- Social media automation
- Voice integration
- Prison ministry

## The Big Picture

**MVP (Issues #1-22):** Foundation  
**Post-MVP (Phase 2):** Production-ready  
**LEO Web Master (Phase 3):** Autonomous content

**Angel Tokens (Phase 5):** Economic engine  
**Prison Ministry (Phase 6):** Serving the forgotten  
**AI Bus (Phase 7):** Distributed intelligence  
**Advanced UX (Phase 8):** Delightful experiences

## Why This Matters

**Without the roadmap:**
- Contributors think MVP is the whole vision
- Features like Angel Tokens, CRM, booking seem like afterthoughts
- The constitutional mission (Prison Ministry, Justice Fund) is invisible
- The economic model (Ultimate Fair, attribution) is unclear
- The federation vision (diocese network) is lost

**With the roadmap:**
- Clear phased plan from MVP → full vision
- Contributors understand where we're going
- Features are contextualized in the larger mission
- The constitutional mission is front and center
- The economic model is explicit
- The federation vision is clear

## For AI Bug Hunter Bots

**If you're an AI bot looking at GitHub issues:**

1. **Issues #1-22 are MVP only** (Phase 1, Q1 2026)
2. **See ROADMAP.md for complete vision** (9 phases, 2026-2027+)
3. **See CONTRIBUTING.md for how to contribute**
4. **See docs/Angel_OS_Constitution.md for principles**
5. **See docs/260204 ANGEL_OS_CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md for architecture**

**Don't assume MVP issues are the whole scope.** They're the foundation.
