In this video, I dive into the brand-new Modular Dashboards introduced in Payload CMS v3.69. Currently in beta, this feature allows developers and users to build fully custom, draggable, and resizable admin interfaces using a system of widgets. I walk through creating custom widgets from scratch, using the Local API to fetch data directly into the admin panel.

Payload CMS just changed the game for admin UIs with Modular Dashboards. In this first-look tutorial, I explore how to move beyond the default view and build a truly personalized experience for your editors and clients.

I’ll cover everything from the initial setup in a Payload 3.69 project to the "nitty-gritty" of widget development. You'll see how to leverage React components and the Payload Local API to create dynamic widgets that show document counts, latest authors, and quick-action buttons.

What you'll learn:
How to enable and edit the new modular layout in version 3.69+.
A step-by-step guide to creating a widget using getPayload and custom TSX components.
Understanding how preferences are saved per-user in the payload-preferences collection.
Using payload/ui components like Card, Link, and Button to match the native admin aesthetic.
Fetching the latest document author and displaying it dynamically within a dashboard widget.

Introducing Payload CMS Modular Dashboards
0:00
What's up everyone? In today's video,
0:03
we're going to take a first look at the
0:05
new modular dashboards by Payload CMS. I
0:09
have not done any kind of research into
0:11
these yet, so I'm just spinning up the
0:13
camera and we're going to go dive into
0:15
the dashboards to see what we can figure
0:17
out. I know that this is in beta, so
0:19
there are a few issues that are still
0:21
being worked out, but I'm hoping that we
0:23
can at least get something up and
0:25
running even with a basic project. So
0:28
this is only available on version 3.69
0:31
and after. So we'll take a look and see
0:34
what we can come up with. Let's just
Setting up the project
0:36
we're going to start with a new project.
0:38
So we'll go to desktop first. Then we'll
0:40
go to
0:43
where I have my tutorial repos. And then
0:46
I have all this in a monor repo now. And
0:49
then this will be for payload. All
0:51
right. And then we're going to run pnpx
0:54
create payload app. And so this is going
0:57
to install at the most recent version
0:59
which means that the dashboards should
1:01
appear immediately. So this is going to
1:04
be modular
1:08
dashboard
1:09
first look. We'll do the website. It'll
1:13
be a MongoDB. So here's the website
1:16
template. Let's put this over on the
1:18
right half. Put this over on the left
1:20
half. I'm done with my terminal. So I
1:23
can close that. And now let's take a
1:26
look at our payload config which should
1:30
be in source payload config. And I'm
1:34
actually let's go ahead and
1:37
um get add get commit
1:42
init commit. And then we're going to run
1:45
pnpmdev to get this up and running and
1:48
see what we have by default in the
1:50
website template because I don't think
1:51
it's going to have the dashboard by any
1:53
means. But if I go to localhost,
1:56
do admin. Let that load up. So, we're
1:59
going to sign up with my normal test
2:02
user. Not now. All right. So, yep. So,
2:05
we've got a dashboard here. That's
2:06
perfect. But I'm going to want to look
2:08
into how to actually add it. All right.
2:11
So, we're going to seed the database.
2:13
We're not going to add any of this. We
Exploring Modular Dashboards
2:15
don't need that anymore. So, I can get
2:18
rid of this. And that should disappear.
2:22
All right. So then we have dashboard.
2:25
Where is the dashboard added? Is it just
2:28
by default then? So it looks like the
2:30
dashboard is on by default. So let's
2:33
take a look at the dashboard since it
2:34
seems to be whenever you install a new
2:37
project at 3.69 or after it
2:40
automatically comes with this dashboard
2:42
dropdown. And here I can edit the
2:45
dashboard. Well, first here it says
2:48
reset layout I assume. And we'll see
2:51
here in a second that this is going to
2:53
save to my preferences. So to my
2:56
preferences, it's going to write what I
2:58
have as my dashboard. So let's go ahead
3:00
and edit the dashboard. And we're going
3:01
to add our collections widget. Okay.
3:05
So we can have multiple collection
3:10
widgets. Interesting. So that's only
3:12
going to be full. So I can only add my
3:16
collections widget. That means that
3:18
there has to be something else we can do
3:20
here. So in components
3:22
there's no dashboard here. Is there a
3:24
dashboard here? There is. All right. So
3:27
now we can take a look
3:30
beyond the default dashboard here which
3:33
is the collections and globals. We can
3:35
click into this and see what our
3:37
dashboard config has. So it looks like
3:41
we have a widgets array or a widgets
3:45
option as well which does take an array.
3:48
So I've got that going. Now, if I save
3:50
this, let's see what happens to my
3:52
dashboard up here. So, collections is
3:54
still there by default. Let's refresh
3:56
before I actually make that claim. We
3:59
still have collections by default. Now,
4:00
in the widgets themselves, we have an
4:02
array of widgets,
4:05
which then has a component path, label,
4:07
max, and midwidth, and a slug. Let's
Creating Our First Widget
4:10
just get something going here. Component
4:13
path is a string. So, we are going to be
4:15
using import maps to make this happen.
4:18
So, what we could do is for our widgets
4:22
in here, we're going to create a new
4:25
file. And for this file, we're going to
4:29
create a widgets folder. And the first
4:32
widget I'm going to create is a
4:36
collection count. And we'll just do a
4:38
tsx file here. We'll do this like any
4:40
other custom field, I believe. So before
4:45
we even do anything, let's export a
4:48
default collection count. And we're just
4:50
going to return an H1. This is a test.
4:54
Export default collection count. Then we
4:57
can come over to our payload config
4:59
widget. So the widget array is going to
5:02
expect a component path and that
5:06
component path is going to be not all of
5:09
that and then a slug. Okay. So, we need
5:13
to add a slug. And this is going to be
5:16
collection count. So, let's see what
5:19
this ends up looking like. If I go to my
5:22
dashboard again, I can add a collection
5:24
count. And then we see this is a test.
5:26
Great. So, we have our collection count.
Fetching Data for Our Widgets
5:28
So, what we need to do is import
5:31
get payload from payload. Import our
5:34
config from payload config. Then we're
5:38
going to
5:40
initialize our payload. But first, this
5:42
needs to be async. So, we'll set payload
5:47
is going to be equal to await payload
5:50
config. Let's just get our pages
5:52
collections. So, I'm going to do
5:53
collections. I guess we have posts. So,
5:56
we're going to limit this to zero. So,
5:58
let's come over back to our dashboard
6:00
and refresh. So, now we can go to our
6:02
dashboard. We can edit the dashboard and
6:04
we can add our collection count. And we
6:06
have three posts. Perfect. We can set
6:09
this to be small, extra large, but none
6:12
of that's going to matter because maybe
6:14
if we do a style, and we just do a
6:18
border of one pix solid black, we can
6:21
add the dashboard. I want to do
6:24
add collection count. We can see that
6:26
there now. And then we can do full,
6:30
extra large,
6:32
large, medium. All right. So, all that
6:35
looks good. We can save those changes.
The Available Configuration Options for Payload’s Modular Dashboards
6:37
So then we have max width and midwidth
6:40
as well as the slug which we did and
6:41
then the label function. So we could
6:44
just do a label and call this one post
6:48
count that is actually going to be this
6:51
here. So if I do collection count just
6:54
to show. Yep. So that's that label here.
6:57
So this label sets the collection count
7:00
there. But I'll just set this to be post
7:01
count because that's all I'm doing with
7:03
this right now. Then we can do a max
7:06
width and a min width. And then the
7:08
widget width is these. So I can do
7:12
something like max width of we'll say
7:15
this probably shouldn't be bigger than
7:16
medium for what it's doing. And then min
7:19
width. I don't really need to change
7:20
this, but we'll do small.
7:23
So now if I save this, let's actually
7:25
reset the layout. Go to edit dashboard.
7:28
Add a post count. And now small and
7:32
medium are all I'm able to get because
7:35
that's what I set. But for the max
7:37
width, I could probably go with extra
7:40
small and go up to medium. I don't
7:42
really want this to take up more than
7:43
half the screen. So if I refresh that,
7:46
let's go add it back. And we'll set this
7:49
to be medium and save those changes.
Exploring Style Options for Payload’s Modular Dashboard
7:52
Let's see what else we got here. Because
7:54
this is not very flexible right now and
7:56
it also doesn't look great. So this is
7:58
where it would be helpful to have
7:59
payloads UI available because I have to
8:03
design all these but that's okay. I want
8:06
it to match over here. I know we can get
8:10
import from payload CMS UI and then
8:15
there should be a card. So let's set
8:18
this then to be a card and see what it
8:21
needs. Title. Okay. And then there is no
8:24
style. Let's refresh this again. And
8:27
then now we can see that the card is
8:29
here. But of course, it's expecting a
8:31
link, which is not great. So I could
8:35
style this myself to be something a
8:37
little bit more usable. So it seems that
8:41
we would need to design this how we want
8:43
it designed because I don't really want
8:45
this card to be clickable. And then of
8:49
course I would want to do something like
8:51
H2 would be let's say posts. And then of
8:57
course we need to do a fragment here.
9:00
Refresh. We got our posts there. But
9:03
that doesn't look great either. So
9:05
instead of the card,
9:07
let's do it this way. Let's set up a new
9:12
div. In that div, we'll actually use an
9:14
H3 which will be post count. Then we can
9:19
do a another div that will have
9:24
collections total docs. So here we're
9:27
going to have display flex flex
9:30
direction column. Then we'll do a
9:33
background color not of white of
9:37
whatever color
9:40
this is. So we got that. Then we can do
9:43
a padding of one rim. And now, of
9:47
course, I know I can just copy the
9:48
styles from the card, but this will work
9:50
just fine. Border radius of half a rim.
9:55
And now, if I come in here and do edit
9:57
dashboard and set this to be extra
9:59
small, I can see that that is being
10:01
changed as we speak. And then instead of
10:04
this, let's do a paragraph tag. We'll do
10:07
style font size is what I'm trying to
10:10
get.
10:12
1.2 rim. We'll see what that looks like.
10:14
Refresh. Okay. Then we will style add
10:20
some margin
10:22
bottom. And this will be one rimish.
10:26
We'll see if that works. Okay, cool. So,
Cleaning Up My Widget and Creating Another One
10:28
we have our component path label max and
10:31
min width and slug, which means that
10:33
this is not really a collection count.
10:35
This is a post count. And then over
10:37
here, we need to change this to be post
10:39
count. Then we can in our widgets. Copy
10:44
this. Paste this. This will be a page is
10:49
count. This will be rename a posts
10:53
count. Now I should be able to go and
10:57
close this up. Then do another widget
11:00
which will be our
11:02
pages count. Pages posts page count. So
11:07
now if we go to our dashboard and we can
11:10
add a page count. So that's still
11:14
labeled as post count because I'm a
11:16
dummy. Let's go here. We need this to be
11:21
page count
11:23
as well as this and this and this. So I
11:29
don't even really need the limit here
11:30
because I'm only getting the total docs.
11:33
Get rid of this as well. Edit a
11:34
dashboard. We will add a post count. So,
11:38
we've got our post count and we'll add a
11:41
page count as well. I guess I can't drag
11:43
it over there, but if I do medium here
11:46
and then medium here, or I can drag this
11:49
up above the collections, which maybe
11:52
that makes more sense. So, I can save
11:54
these changes. Now, if I go to add a
11:56
post,
11:58
new post,
12:00
required text. So, let's publish those
12:03
changes. If I go back to our collections
12:07
here, I now see I have four posts
12:09
instead. So I can do whatever I want
Adding Functionality to the Modular Dashboard
12:12
with these. So if I wanted to add this
12:15
link here, I could. So I can copy the
12:17
link. We're in the posts collection.
12:21
Let's do
12:23
another div with a link which I'm going
12:26
to get from not next link. I want to get
12:29
this import link
12:33
from
12:34
payload CMS UI which is just a wrapper
12:37
for the next link. So this works out. I
12:41
can just do add post
12:43
and that is going to be I wonder if I
12:47
can actually do a button instead. So if
12:49
I do button
12:53
button then the href will just be our
12:57
we'll want to change this to be should
13:00
have
13:01
get server side URL. All right. So the
13:04
link happens inside the button or
13:06
outside the button. So if I do that link
13:09
again. So let's import our link as well.
13:14
So if we do link that's not the right
13:17
link. Got the whole href. So I can do
13:20
this. Now the button's wrapped in a
13:22
link. And if I refresh, I see add post
13:25
there. And if I click on add post, it
13:28
brings me to the post
13:31
thing there. So that means if this these
13:33
collections get pushed down because of
13:35
my widgets, that's okay because I've got
13:38
it handled. But now, so maybe this
13:42
actually just needs to be
13:44
that.
13:46
go back to our dashboard which will be
13:49
here. So we got four and then now I can
13:52
click that and get what I need. I can
13:55
just copy this div, come over to our
13:58
pages count
14:00
and do the same thing. We'll do pages
14:02
instead. Add page. Can refresh. And now
14:06
I see that I've got my add page and add
14:10
post. We can then set this to be extra
14:12
small and this one to be small. and then
14:15
save changes. And we have those there.
14:17
So, a lot of flexibility here with how
14:20
you design what you have. But let's do a
14:25
border. And we'll do a border over here
14:27
as well. Now, of course, I could have
14:30
like actual components. Like this div is
14:33
the same as the other div, but none of
14:35
that really matters because I'm just
14:36
trying to get this working. So, I've got
14:39
add page, add post. Can I do size? Let's
14:43
do
14:44
small.
14:46
I like that better, but it's still not
How Dashboards are Saved and Accessed
14:48
quite what I want. So, what I see right
14:51
now for the dashboard is that this is
14:54
going to be for my user. So, it's going
14:57
to be a little hard to see cuz I know
14:59
this text is a little smaller, but by my
15:01
face, this is all being posted to the
15:04
payload preferences, which means that my
15:06
user is the one that will see this.
15:10
I can reset the preferences. So if I do
15:12
this and go back to the dashboard, that
15:14
gets cleared. So if I then edit the
15:17
dashboard and just we'll add the post
15:19
count back because it doesn't really
15:20
matter and save the changes, we'll again
15:23
see that this posts to my preferences.
15:26
If I go to users, I can create a new
15:30
me and save that. We'll log out. So I'm
15:34
clicking the log out button. Then I can
15:35
do
15:37
I don't see the dashboard that I just
15:40
created. So,
15:42
right now it doesn't seem to have any
15:45
default settings. I do think, if I
15:49
remember right, we'll go to the pull
15:53
request. They have future work here
15:55
where they're going to have dashboard
15:56
presets. So those presets will be able
16:00
to be used by any of your users, but
16:03
currently in the the state that it's in
16:05
right now will not have any ability to
16:10
have like a dashboard default. Not yet.
16:13
This is in beta as I mentioned at the
16:15
top of this. So it's not surprising that
16:18
we don't have that kind of functionality
16:20
yet, but it is on the way. So, I'm also
16:25
looking forward to any kind of not just
16:29
default for the presets, like those will
16:32
be super helpful to have defaults that
16:34
you can define and use for other people,
16:37
but I'd like to see some also generic
16:40
basic components that are defined for
16:42
you or really what we need is the UI to
16:46
be exported fully so I don't have to
16:49
like design everything from scratch, but
16:52
to have a way to get my collections or
16:57
my widgets to match the admin UI. It's
17:02
really impressive work. So, don't get me
17:03
wrong that a simple implementation is a
17:06
bad thing. Let's go look at our post
Adding Latest Publishing Author
17:08
real quick. And I can see authors.
17:11
Perfect. All right. So, what I want to
17:14
do is we're going to set myself as an
17:16
author here. So, I'm going to publish
17:18
those changes. And then over in my post
17:21
count, I could do something like we'll
17:24
do another div. Um, let's actually do a
17:27
horizontal rule here. We could do we'll
17:31
do
17:32
sort
17:34
think it's going to be this way though.
17:37
And we'll do most recent post be
17:42
collections docs zero. That should be
17:45
right. Then I should be able to do from
17:49
our most recent post we can get most
17:52
recent author or let's do latest author
17:57
and we'll do most recent post meta
17:59
author. I don't think it's actually
18:01
meta. So I think it's just going to be
18:02
author populated author. So here we can
18:05
do populated authors. So then we should
18:08
set depth to two just to make sure
18:11
though I think that's the default. Then
18:13
down here I can do populated or uh
18:17
latest author
18:20
name. So first it does need to be
18:22
negative created at then
18:25
we need latest author is going to
18:28
actually be this and then we should be
18:32
able to get name from there. So now if I
18:33
save that and refresh, I get the latest
18:36
author, last
18:38
post published by,
18:42
and now I see down here at the bottom
18:44
that I can say who the last post was
18:46
published by. So if I add a post, I can
18:48
then set my author to demo author
18:52
required
18:56
required. So put in all of our required
18:57
fields, publish that. Go back to our
19:01
dashboard. And I can see now that the
19:02
last post published was by the demo
Closing Thoughts and Next Steps
19:04
author. And that's it for Modular
19:06
Dashboards. If you found this video
